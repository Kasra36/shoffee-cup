# Shoffee Cup ☕

Shoffee Cup is a user-friendly web platform that helps coffee lovers, students, and remote workers discover the best nearby cafés. Users can find the nearest cafés, browse by city/district/neighborhood, rate them, and view their locations on a map.  

This project is built using **Python (Flask)**, **Bootstrap 5**, and integrates the **Geoapify Places API** for finding cafés.
